:recycle_bin_background_plug:
> Set to **Yes** to enable the Recycle Bin Size to be updated in the background every minute.  This can make the Recycle Bin Settings and Shares pages more responsive and prevent disk spinups when accessing the Recycle Bin.  The Recycle Bin size can take up to a minute to refresh when this is enabled.

:recycle_bin_ud_plug:
> Set to **Yes** to enable the Recycle Bin deleted file functionality on Unassigned Devices drive shares when the Unassigned Devices plugin is installed.  SMB/NFS mounts and iso mounts are excluded from the Recycle Bin functionality on this server.  Enable the Recycle Bin on the remote server where the remote share originates if it is an Unraid server.

> Additional parameters for Recycle Bin.  The following are some options you can set to control the file structure of the deleted files.
> Enter the parameters in a list with no spaces or commas between them.
> The order of the parameters will affect the file structure in the Recycle Bin.
> Leaving this field blank will put all deleted files in the Recycle Bin without any path information.
>
> Hint: Use the '/' for more control of the directory structure in the Recycle Bin.
> For example '%m/%S' will organize the deleted files by the machine name that deleted the file and then the share name structure.
>
> + '%S' Samba share name (which in Unraid equals the share name), eg. Storage
> + '%P' User share full path, eg /mnt/user/Storage, /mnt/disk1, /mnt/disks/unassigned_device, /flash
> + '%u' Username of the current service, if any
> + '%m' Machine name of the user who deleted the file

> List of shares to exclude from the Recycle Bin separated by commas.  This list can include Unassigned Devices shares.  The share name is case sensitive.

> The excluded share can include part of a share name and will exclude all shares with the excluded share text in the actual share name.  If you want an exact match, use the full share name.
>
> For example: 'Squidbait' (without quotes) will exclude all shares created by the Ransom Ware plugin.
>
> Note: Excluding a share only excludes it from deleted files going to the .Recycle.Bin folder on the share.  Files in the existing .Recycle.Bin folder will still show in the total size and on the 'Shares' tab.

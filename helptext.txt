**Identification** is the *signature* that uniquely identifies a storage device. The signature
includes the device model number, serial number, linux device id, and the device size.

**Temp.** (temperature) is read directly from the device. You configure which units to use on
the [Display Preferences](Settings/DisplaySettings) page.  We do not read the temperature of spun-down hard
drives since this typically causes them to spin up; instead we display the `*` symbol.  We also
display the `*` symbol for SSD and Flash devices, though sometimes these devices do report a valid
temperature, and sometimes they return the value `0`.

**Size, Used, Free** reports the total device size, used space, and remaining space for files.  These
units are also configured on the [Display Preferences](Settings/DisplaySettings) page.  The
amount of space used will be non-zero even for an empty disk due to file system overhead.

*Note: for a multi-device cache pool, this data is for the entire pool as returned by btrfs.*

**Reads, Writes** are a count of I/O requests sent to the device I/O drivers.  These statistics may
be cleared at any time, refer to the Array Status section below.

**Errors** counts the number of *unrecoverable* errors reported by the device
I/O drivers. Missing data due to unrecoverable array read errors is filled in on-the-fly using parity
reconstruct (and we attempt to write this data back to the sector(s) which failed). Any unrecoverable
write error results in *disabling* the disk.

**FS** indicates the file system detected in partition 1 of the device.

**View** column contains a folder icon indicating the device is *mounted*. Click the icon to
browse the file system.

If "Display array totals" is enable on the [Display Preferences](Settings/DisplaySettings) page, a
**Total** line is included which provides a tally of the device statistics, including the average temperature
of your devices.

The Array must be Stopped in order to change Array device assignments.

An Unraid array consists of one or two Parity disks and a number of Data disks. The Data
disks are exclusively used to store user data, and the Parity disk(s) provides the redundancy necessary
to recover from disk failures.

Since data is not striped across the array, the Parity disk(s) must be as large, or larger than the largest Data
disk.  Parity should also be your highest performance drive.

Each Data disk has its own file system and can be exported as a
separate share.

**Pool Devices** is a single device, or pool of multiple devices, *outside* the Unraid array.  It may be exported for network access just
like an Array device.  Being outside the Unraid array results in significantly faster write access.

There are two ways to configure the Pool devices:

1. As a single device, or
2. As a multi-device pool.

When configured as a single device you may format the device using any supported file system (btrfs, reiserfs,
or xfs).  This configuration offers the highest performance, but at the cost of no data protection - if the
single pool device fails all data contained on it may be lost.

When configured as a multi-device pool, Unraid OS will automatically select *btrfs-raid1* format (for both data
and meta-data).  btrfs permits any number of devices to be added to the pool and each copy of data is guaranteed
to be written to two different devices.  Hence the pool can withstand a single-disk failure without losing data.

When [User Shares](/Settings/ShareSettings) are enabled, user shares may be configured to
automatically make use of the Pool device in order to
speed up writes.  A special background process called the *mover* can be scheduled to run
periodically to move user share files off the Cache and onto the Array.

#### Assigning Devices

An unRAID disk array consists of a single parity disk and a number of data disks. The data
disks are exclusively used to store user data, and the parity disk provides the redundancy necessary
to recover from any singe disk failure.

Note that we are careful to use the term *disk* when referring to an array storage device.  We
use the term *hard drive* (or sometimes just *drive*) when referring to an actual hard disk drive (HDD)
device. This is because in a RAID system it is possible to read/write an array disk whose corresponding
hard drive is disabled or even missing! In addition, it is useful to be able to ask, "which device is
assigned to be the parity disk?"; or, "which device corresponds to disk2?".

We therefore need a way to assign hard drives to array disks. This is accomplished here on the
Main page when the array is stopped. There is a drop-down box for each array disk which lists all the
unassigned devices. To assign a device simply select it from the list. Each time a device
assignment is made, the system updates a configuration file to record the assignment.

#### Requirements

Unlike traditional RAID systems which stripe data across all the array devices, an unRAID server
stores files on individual hard drives. Consequently, all file write operations will involve both the
data disk the file is being written to, and the parity disk. For these reasons,

* the parity disk size must be as large or larger than any of the data disks,

and

* given a choice, the parity disk should be the fastest disk in your collection.

#### Guidelines

Here are the steps you should follow when designing your unRAID disk array:

1. Decide which hard drive you will use for parity, and which hard drives you will use for
data disk1, disk2, etc., and label them in some fashion. Also, find the serial number of each hard
drive and jot it down somewhere; you will need this information later.

2. Install your hard drive devices, boot unRAID Server and bring up the webGui. If this is a fresh system
build, then the Main page will show no disks installed. This doesn't mean the system can't detect your
hard drives; it just means that none have been assigned yet.

3. Remember the serial numbers you recored back in step 1? For parity and each data disk, select the
proper hard drive based on its serial number from the drop down list.

#### Hot Plug

You may also *hot plug* hard drives into your server if your hardware supports it. For example,
if you are using hard drive cages, you may simply plug them into your server while powered on and
with array Stopped. Refresh the Main page to have new unassigned devices appear in the assignment
dropdown lists.

#### Next Steps

Once you have assigned all of your hard drives, refer to the Array Status section below
and Start the array.
:end

:encryption_help:
#### Encryption input

With array Stopped, the user can specify a new encryption key. Note that once a device
is formatted with a particular key it may only be opened using that same key. Changing the encryption key requires
encrypted devices to be reformatted **resulting in permanent loss of all existing data on those devices.**

#### Passphrase

Enter a passphrase of up to 512 characters. It is highly advisable to only use the 95 printable characters from the
first 128 characters of the [ASCII table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), as they will always have the same binary
representation. Other characters may have different encoding depending on system configuration and your passphrase will
not work with a different encoding. If you want a longer passphrase or to include binary data, upload a keyfile instead.

Please refer to the [cryptsetup FAQ](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#5-security-aspects)
for what constitutes a *secure* passphrase.

**Memorize** this passphrase. **IF LOST, ENCRYPTED CONTENT CANNOT BE RECOVERED!**

#### Keyfile

Select a local keyfile with a stored encryption key or a binary file. The maximum size of the keyfile is 8M (8388608 byte).

**Backup** your local keyfile. **IF LOST, ENCRYPTED CONTENT CANNOT BE RECOVERED!**

:info_btrfs_balance_help:
**Balance** will run the *btrfs balance* program to restripe the extents across all pool devices, for example,
to convert the pool from raid1 to raid0 or vice-versa.

When a *full balance* is perfomred, it basically rewrites everything in the current filesystem.

A *mode conversion* affects the btrfs data extents; metadata always uses raid1 and is converted to raid1 if necessary by any balance operation.

The run time is potentially very long, depending on the filesystem size and speed of the device.

Unraid uses these default options when creating a multiple-device pool:

`-dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1`

For more complete documentation, please refer to the btrfs-balance [Manpage](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-balance)

has free space above the current *high water mark*, divide the *high water mark* by 2 and choose again.

The goal of **High-water** is to write as much data as possible to each disk (in order to minimize
how often disks need to be spun up), while at the same time, try to keep the same amount of free space on
each disk (in order to distribute data evenly across the array).

**Fill-up**

:share_edit_split_level_help:
Determines whether a directory is allowed to expand onto multiple disks.

**Automatically split any directory as required**
When a new file or subdirectory needs to be created in a share, Unraid OS first chooses which disk
it should be created on, according to the configured *Allocation method*.  If the parent directory containing
the new file or or subdirectory does not exist on this disk, then Unraid OS will first create all necessary
parent directories, and then create the new file or subdirectory.

**Automatically split only the top level directory as required**
When a new file or subdirectory is being created in the first level subdirectory of a share, if that first
level subdirectory does not exist on the disk being written, then the subdirectory will be created first.
If a new file or subdirectory is being created in the second or lower level subdirectory of a share, the new
file or subdirectory is created on the same disk as the new file or subdirectory's parent directory.

**Automatically split only the top "N" level directories as required**
Similar to previous: when a new file or subdirectory is being created, if the parent directory is at level "N",
and does not exist on the chosen disk, Unraid OS will first create all necessary parent directories.  If the
parent directory of the new file or subdirectory is beyond level "N", then the new file or subdirectory is
created on the same disk where the parent directory exists.

**Manual: do not automatically split directories**
When a new file or subdirectory needs to be created in a share, Unraid OS will only consider disks where the
parent directory already exists.

**No** prohibits new files and subdirectories from being written onto the Cache disk/pool.
*Mover* will take no action so any existing files for this share that are on the cache are left there.

**Yes** indicates that all new files and subdirectories should be written to the Cache disk/pool, provided
enough free space exists on the Cache disk/pool.
If there is insufficient space on the Cache disk/pool, then new files and directories are created on the array.
When the *mover* is invoked, files and subdirectories are transferred off the Cache disk/pool and onto the array.

**Only** indicates that all new files and subdirectories must be writen to the Cache disk/pool.
If there is insufficient free space on the Cache disk/pool, *create* operations will fail with *out of space* status.
*Mover* will take no action so any existing files for this share that are on the array are left there.

**Prefer** indicates that all new files and subdirectories should be written to the Cache disk/pool, provided
enough free space exists on the Cache disk/pool.
If there is insufficient space on the Cache disk/pool, then new files and directories are created on the array.
When the *mover* is invoked, files and subdirectories are transferred off the array and onto the Cache disk/pool.

:smb_case_sensitive_names_help:
Controls whether filenames are case-sensitive.

The default setting of **auto** allows clients that support case sensitive filenames (Linux CIFSVFS)
to tell the Samba server on a per-packet basis that they wish to access the file system in a case-sensitive manner (to support UNIX
case sensitive semantics). No Windows system supports case-sensitive filenames so setting this option to **auto** is the same as
setting it to No for them; however, the case of filenames passed by a Windows client will be preserved.  This setting can result
in reduced peformance with very large directories because Samba must do a filename search and match on passed names.

A setting of **Yes** means that files are created with the case that the client passes, and only accessible using this same case.
This will speed very large directory access, but some Windows applications may not function properly with this setting.  For
example, if "MyFile" is created but a Windows app attempts to open "MYFILE" (which is permitted in Windows), it will not be found.

A value of **Forced lower** is special: the case of all incoming client filenames, not just new filenames, will be set to lower-case.
In other words, no matter what mixed case name is created on the Windows side, it will be stored and accessed in all lower-case.  This
ensures all Windows apps will properly find any file regardless of case, but case will not be preserved in folder listings.
Note this setting should only be configured for new shares.

When ***Apply*** is pressed a scan is performed to find the changes, subsequently containers which have changes are modified in parallel.

*Important: Please wait until all updates are finished before leaving this page*.

By default NO cores are selected for a Docker container, which means it uses all available cores.<br>
Do not select **ALL** cores for containers, just select **NO** cores if you want unrestricted core use.

Do not select cores for containers which are *isolated*.
By design a container will only use a single core (the lowest numbered core) when multiple isolated cores are selected.<br>

CPU isolation allows the user to specify CPU cores that are to be explicitly reserved for assignment (to VMs or Docker containers).

This is incredibly important for gaming VMs to run smoothly because even if you manually pin your Docker containers to not overlap with your gaming VM,
the host OS can still utilize those same cores as the guest VM needs for things like returning responses for the webGui, running a parity check, btrfs operations, etc.

Determines how the webGUI responds to HTTP and/or HTTPS protocol.

Select **No** to disable HTTPS

Select **Yes** to enable HTTPS and redirect HTTP to HTTPS. If a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate has not
been provisioned, then an automatically generated self-signed SSL certificate will be used.

Select **Auto** if you are using or plan to use a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate provisioned
by Lime Technology. Before the certificate is provisioned, the webGUI remains
in http-mode. After provisioning, the webGUI automatically switches to https-mode. In addition
two background processes are enabled:

- *updatedns* - This starts 30 seconds after server reboot has completed and contacts the Lime Technology
DNS service to register the servers local IP address. Thereafter it wakes up every 10 minutes in case
the local IP address has changed again.

- *renewcert* - This starts 60 seconds after server reboot has completed and contacts the Lime Technology
certificate renewal service to determine if your Let's Encrypt SSL certificate needs to be renewed.
Thereafter it wakes up every 24 hours. If within 30 days of expiration, a new certificate is automatically
provisioned and downloaded to your server.

Note: After provisioning a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate you may turn off the *updatedns* and *newcert*
background processes by changing this field to **Yes**.

**nginx certificate handling details**

The nginx startup script looks for a SSL certificate on the USB boot flash in this order:<br>
`config/ssl/certs/certificate_bundle.pem`<br>
`config/ssl/certs/<server-name>_unraid_bundle.pem`

If neither file exists, a self-signed SSL certificate is automatically created and stored in<br>
`config/ssl/certs/<server-name>_unraid_bundle.pem`<br>

Provisioning a Let's Encrypt certificate writes the certificate to<br>
`config/ssl/certs/certificate_bundle.pem`<br>

**nginx stapling support**

Whether nginx enables OCSP Staping is determined by which certificate is in use:<br>
`config/ssl/certs/certificate_bundle.pem` => Yes<br>
`config/ssl/certs/<server-name>_unraid_bundle.pem` => No

**Provision** may be used to allocate a *free* SSL Certficiate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and
then upload to your server. Note: We **highly** recommend using a static IP address in this case.

**Update DNS** may be used to manually initiate updating the DNS A-record of your server FQDN on unraid.net. Note
that DNS propagation change could take anywhere from 1 minute to several hours (we set TTL to 60 seconds).

Note: **Provision** may fail if your router or upstream DNS server has
[DNS rebinding protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding) enabled. DNS rebinding
protection prevents DNS from resolving a private IP network range. DNS rebinding protection is meant as
a security feature on a local LAN which includes legacy devices with buggy/insecure "web" interfaces.

One source of DNS rebinding protection could be your ISP DNS server. In this case the problem may be solved by
switching to a different DNS server such as Google's public DNS.

More commonly, DNS rebinding protection could be enabled in your router. Most consumer routers do not implement DNS
rebinding protection; but, if they do, a configuration setting should be available to turn it off.

Higher end routers usually do enable DNS rebinding protection however. Typically there are ways of turning it off
entirely or selectively based on domain. Examples:

**DD-WRT:** If you are using "dnsmasq" with DNS rebinding protection enabled, you can add this line to your router
configuration file:

`rebind-domain-ok=/unraid.net/`

**pfSense:** If you are using pfSense internal DNS resolver service, you can add these Custom Option lines:

`server:`<br>
`private-domain: "unraid.net"`

**Ubiquiti USG router:** you can add this configuration line:

`set service dns forwarding options rebind-domain-ok=/unraid.net/`

**OpenDNS:** Go to Settings -> Security and *remove* the checkbox next to
 "Suspicious Responses - Block internal IP addresses". It is an all-or-nothing setting.

When all else fails, you can create an entry in your PC's *hosts* file to override external DNS and
directly resolve your servers unraid.net FQDN to its local IP address.

:nfs_enable_help:
Select 'Yes' to enable the NFS protocol.
:end

:nfs_tunable_fuse_remember_help:
When NFS is enabled, this Tunable may be used to alleviate or solve instances of "NFS Stale File Handles"
you might encounter with your NFS client.

In essence, (fuse_remember) tells an internal subsystem (named "fuse") how long to "remember" or "cache"
file and directory information associated with user shares.  When an NFS client attempts to access a file
(or directory) on the server, and that file (or directory) name is not cached, then you could encounter
"stale file handle".

The numeric value of this tunable is the number of seconds to cache file/directory name entries,
where the default value of 330 indicates 5 1/2 minutes.  There are two special values you may also set
this to:

* 0 which means, do not cache file/directory names at all, and
* -1 which means cache file/directory names forever (or until array is stopped)

A value of 0 would be appropriate if you are enabling NFS but only plan to use it for disk shares,
not user shares.

A value of -1 would be appropriate if no other timeout seems to solve the "stale file handle" on
your client.  Be aware that setting a value of -1 will cause the memory footprint to grow by approximately
108 bytes per file/directory name cached.  Depending how much RAM is installed in your server and how many
files/directories you access via NFS this may or may not lead to out-of-memory conditions.

:eth_enable_bonding_help:
绑定是一种将多个物理网络接口合并为一个名为 **bond0** 的单个 *被绑定* 接口的特性。
该选项可用于提高连接冗余和/或系统的吞吐量。
支持多种不同的绑定模式（如下），但某些模式需要合适的交换机支持。
:end

:eth_bonding_mode_help:
**模式 0（平衡 - 轮循）**<br>
该模式将从第一个可用的从属接口到最后一个，按顺序传输数据包。
当两个物理接口从属于同一个绑定，且两个数据包的到达目标均为该绑定接口时，第一个数据包奖杯传输给第一个从属接口，而第二帧则会被传输到第二个从属接口。
第三个数据包会被传输到第一个从属接口，如此反复。该模式能提供负载均衡和容错。

**模式 1（主动备份） - 默认**<br>
该模式将其中的一个接口置于备份状态，并且只会在主动接口的链接丢失时激活该接口。
在同一时间实例内，只有一个绑定中的从属接口为活跃状态。只有在活跃的从属接口故障时，才会激活另一个从属接口。
该模式能提供容错。

**模式 2（平衡 - 异或）**<br>
该模式基于异或公式传输数据包。源 MAC 地址与目标 MAC 地址通过异或公式对从属接口数取模。
这将对每个目标 MAC 地址选择相同的从属接口，从而提供负载均衡和容错。

**模式 3（广播）**<br>
该模式在所有从属接口上传输所有数据包。该模式仅偶尔使用（用于特定目的），且只提供容错。

**模式 4（802.3ad）**<br>
该模式被称作*动态链路聚合*。通过创建聚合组来共享相同的速度和双工设置。
需要交换机支持 IEEE 802.3ad 动态链路。
根据选定的传输哈希策略对传出流量的从属接口进行选择，可以通过 xmit_hash_policy 选项来从默认的简单异或策略更改为其他策略。
注意并非所有的传输策略都与 802.3ad 兼容，尤其是 802.3ad 标准的 43.2.4 章节中关于 packet mis-ordering 要求的地方。
不同个例的实现往往有着不同的兼容表现。

**模式 5（平衡 - 传输负载平衡）**<br>
该模式被称为 *自适应传输负载均衡*。传出流量根据现有的每个从属接口的负载和序列情况进行分发。
传入流量由现有的从属接口接收。

**模式 6（平衡 - 自适应负载平衡）**<br>
该模式被称为 *自适应负载均衡* ，包括平衡 - 传输负载平衡和对 IPV4 流量的接收负载平衡 (rlb) 。
接收负载均衡利用 ARP 协商来实现。
绑定的驱动将拦截服务器发出的 ARP 回应报文，并且用绑定中的某一个从属接口的独有硬件地址改写源硬件地址，
使得服务器对不同的客户端使用不同的硬件地址。

*推荐设置为模式 1（主动备份）。其他模式允许您设置特定的环境，但可能需要合适的交换机支持。
选择一个不支持的模式可能导致通信中断。*

:apc_runtime_left_help:
If during a power failure, the remaining runtime in minutes (as calculated internally by the UPS) is below or equal to this field, apcupsd, will initiate a system shutdown.
:end

:apc_battery_time_help:
If during a power failure, the UPS has run on batteries for *time-out* many seconds or longer; apcupsd will initiate a system shutdown. A value of zero disables this timer.

If you have a Smart UPS, you will most likely want to disable this timer by setting it to zero.
That way, your UPS will continue on batteries until either the % charge remaining drops to or below *Battery level* or the remaining battery runtime drops to or below *minutes*.

Of course - when testing - setting this to 60 causes a quick system shutdown if you pull the power plug.
If you have an older dumb UPS, you will want to set this to less than the time you know you can run on batteries.
:end

:apc_note_help:
**Note:** *Battery level*, *Runtime left*, and *Time on battery* work in conjunction, so the first that occurs will cause the initiation of a shutdown.

Templates are a quicker way to setting up Docker Containers on your Unraid server.  There are two types of templates:

**Default templates**<br>
When valid repositories are added to your Docker Repositories page, they will appear in a section on this drop down for you to choose (master categorized by author, then by application template).
After selecting a default template, the page will populate with new information about the application in the Description field, and will typically provide instructions for how to setup the container.
Select a default template when it is the first time you are configuring this application.

**User-defined templates**<br>
Once you've added an application to your system through a Default template,
the settings you specified are saved to your USB flash device to make it easy to rebuild your applications in the event an upgrade were to fail or if another issue occurred.
To rebuild, simply select the previously loaded application from the User-defined list and all the settings for the container will appear populated from your previous setup.

:docker_post_arguments_help:
If you wish to append additional arguments AFTER the container definition, you can specify them here.
The content of this field is container specific.
:end

:docker_cpu_pinning_help:
Checking a CPU core(s) will limit the container to run on the selected cores only. Selecting no cores lets the container run on all available cores (default)
:end

:docker_fixed_ip_help:
If the Bridge type is selected, the application’s network access will be restricted to only communicating on the ports specified in the port mappings section.
If the Host type is selected, the application will be given access to communicate using any port on the host that isn’t already mapped to another in-use application/service.
Generally speaking, it is recommended to leave this setting to its default value as specified per application template.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  If adjusting port mappings, do not modify the settings for the Container port as only the Host port can be adjusted.
:end

:docker_privileged_help:
For containers that require the use of host-device access directly or need full exposure to host capabilities, this option will need to be selected.

; sysdevs help - added May 18, 2020
:sysdevs_iommu_groups_help:
This displays a list of IOMMU groups available on your system along with the output of the `lspci` command for each IOMMU group.  The numeric identifiers are used to configure PCI pass-through.

Devices you select will be bound to the vfio-pci driver at boot, which makes them available for assignment to a virtual machine, and also prevents the Linux kernel from automatically binding them to any present host driver.

**Note that selecting a device will bind not only the specified device(s), but *all* other devices in the same IOMMU group as well.**

&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-circle orb green-orb middle"></i>&nbsp;This symbol indicates the device is currently bound to the vfio-pci driver.

&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-retweet grey-orb middle"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This symbol indicates the device supports FLR (Function Level Reset).

<input type="checkbox" value="" disabled>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a checkbox is greyed out it means the device is in use by Unraid and can not be passed through.

:sysdevs_thread_pairings_help:
This displays a list of CPU thread pairings.
:end

:sysdevs_usb_devices_help:
This displays the output of the `lsusb` command.  The numeric identifiers are used to configure PCI pass-through.
:end

:sysdevs_scsi_devices_help:
This displays the output of the `lsscsi` command.  The numeric identifiers are used to configure PCI pass-through.

Note that linux groups ATA, SATA and SAS devices with true SCSI devices.
